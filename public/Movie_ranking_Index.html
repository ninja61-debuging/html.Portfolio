<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>Really good on the action and the possiblities, really love the story line too!</p>

<h3>Alita Battle Angle</h3>
<p>I like the idea behind it and has a really action packed story line and wish there was a second movie to continue on what they started to find out what will happen! 10/10</p>

<h3>Spider Man: Into the spiderverse</h3>
<p>I really love the graphics of this movie! It Changed the whole perspective of how movies can be made. Not only that, but the story line is super good too! Love the action and super
